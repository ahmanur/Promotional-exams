Payments System Vision 2025

The CBN's regulatory approach to the payments system is anchored on its Payments System Vision 2025 (PSV 2025), a comprehensive five-year strategic roadmap launched in 2022. PSV 2025 builds on the successes of the earlier PSV 2020 initiative, aiming to:
1. Strengthen adoption of electronic payments

3. Foster financial inclusion, especially for the unbanked and underserved populations
4. Catalyze Nigeria's economic growth through efficient payment system
5. Implement a payment system that would be nationally utilized and internationally recognized

CBN first published the Payments System Vision (PSV) 2020 in 2006, to provide a roadmap for the reform of the Nigerian payments system and to drive adoption of epayments in different sectors of the economy and improving the resilience of the industry. The strategy was revised in 2013 to address emerging issues and further revised in 2022.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives
Payments System Vision 2025 (cont.)

With the rapid pace of growth in digital financial services the PSV 2025 was released to focus on emerging innovative technologies and their benefits to the Nigerian Economy. They include; Distributed Ledger Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Open Banking, Big Data, Cyber Security, Digital Identity and User Authentication, Machine Learning and Robotics Process Automation. The Bank has made significant strides in achieving the 2025 mandate and is currently seeking management's approval for the review and update of the PSV 2025 Strategy to reflect emerging realities and current CBN corporate strategy with a vision towards 20??`,
    
    `Payments System Initiatives
Cash-Less Policy

First introduced with a pilot in Lagos 2012, with subsequent adjustments in 2013 (6 States) and nationwide implementation in 2020.
The policy was adopted to reduce the high usage of cash, moderate the cost of cash management and encourage the use of electronic payment channels. The policy initially introduced daily withdrawal, and lodgment limits for individual and corporate bank customers, with processing fees for deposits/withdrawals above the threshold.
Processing Fees on deposits were subsequently suspended. However withdrawal limits and respective processing fees were reviewed in December 2022 with the Naira Redesign Policy.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives

The Nigeria electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF)

The body was inaugurated in December, 2011 as part of CBN's effort at increasing the efficiency of the financial sector through the proactive management of e-fraud issues. It is a group of industry stakeholders with a holistic approach to combat the menace of electronic payment fraud and restore confidence in all e-payment mechanisms. Membership includes; CBN, Financial Institutions, eFraud prevention experts, judiciary and law enforcement agencies.
The Forum has grown to become a hub for knowledge sharing, policy initiation and formulation and capacity, all centered on a proactive approach to fraud prevention. Achievements of NeFF include: Awareness creation on eFraud control measures through various learning and training sessions; Enhanced cooperation amongst stakeholders; Establishment of a dedicated e-Payment and Card Crime Unit by the Nigerian Police; Recommendations on eFraud mitigating measures made to the CBN.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives
Bank Verification Number (BVN)

The absence of a unique identifier in the Nigerian banking industry had been a major challenge inhibiting the effectiveness of the Know Your Customer (KYC) principle, with negative consequences on the growth of electronic payments. To complement the existing means of identification of customers, the CBN, in collaboration with the Bankers' Committee, on February 14, 2014, launched the BVN project. The initiative is aimed at protecting bank customers from identity theft, and strengthening the Nigerian banking system by uniquely identifying all bank customers.

Additionally, a BVN Watch-list has been established through a industry-wide database of financial institution customers' identified by their BVNs, who have been involved in confirmed fraudulent incidences or received proceeds from financial fraud.`,
    
    `Payments System Initiatives
Agent Banking

Agent banking was introduced to encourage the deployment of agent banking services by third party service providers, who would enhance the financial inclusion drive of the country. The initiative encourages the set-up of financial touch points, across different geographical locations, especially rural, and hard to reach locations.
Agent provide financial services at their locations on behalf of a FI or MMO.
Subsequently the Super Agent Regime was introduced and then the SANEF to facilitate the proliferation of financial touch point across all locations.
The Bank has reviewed the Guidelines and is currently seeking Management's approval to release.`,
    
    `Payments System Initiatives
Cheque Truncation System (CTS)

With a view to increasing the efficiency of cheque clearing, the CBN through NIBSS, introduced the CTS in 2013. CTS is the dematerialization of a physical cheque or its conversion to an electronic form, for transmission to the paying bank. Its implementation has helped to further reduce the cost and days for clearing instruments from T+2 to T+1.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS) Compliance

- With increasing integration with the international world and the need for the payments industry to be at par with the best, the CBN mandated all Banks, Switches and Processors to comply with (PCIDSS) and continues to carry out yearly oversight.
- PCI DSS is mandatory for any entity that processes, stores/saves or transmit payment card data.`,
    
    `Payments System Initiatives
Regulatory Sandbox

Regulatory Sandbox which is a formal process for firms to conduct live tests of new, innovative products, services, delivery channels, or business models in a controlled environment, with regulatory oversight, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards. This would enable the Bank stay abreast of innovations while promoting a safe, reliable and efficient Payments System to foster innovation without compromising on the delivery of its mandate.
- Lowers the entry barrier/regulatory requirements (Capital, infrastructure, resources) for licensing
- Provides start ups with an avenue to commercially and legally enter the payments space
- Provides CBN with insight into innovative financial services while aiding policy creation and adjustments

    `Payments System Initiatives
Contactless Payments

Contactless payments refer to payments made without physically touching a payment terminal or device. Instead of using traditional methods like inserting a card into a chip reader or swiping a card, contactless payments use near-field communication (NFC) technology or QR Codes to facilitate transactions between two devices (e.g., a phone and a point-of-sale terminal) in proximity. This method offers a fast, secure, and convenient alternative to cash and traditional card payments. Payments can be made using cards, smartphones, or wearables and suitable for low value payments in high traffic locations.

The Guidelines on Contactless Payments in Nigeria were released in 2023 and provides that contactless payments through accounts or wallets in Nigeria shall have a transaction limit of N15,000 and a daily cumulative limit of N50,000.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives
QR Code Payment

With increased demand for more convenient and faster means of payments at retail locations, Quick Response (QR) code payments was introduced to reduce the bottlenecks, wait time and hygiene around purchases using payment cards/PoS terminals and cash.

CBN released the Framework for quick response (QR) code payments in Nigeria in 2021. It works by scanning a QR code from a mobile app/device to make payments. Its implementation in Nigeria supports account, wallet, card and token based QR Code Operations. Allows the implementation of other customer centric services like menu, etc.`,
    
    `Payments System Initiatives
Open (API) Banking

Premised on the Payment Service Directive (PSD2) requirements of the European Central Bank that mandates banks to open customer information to third-party payment service providers to build and provide innovative financial services.

The implementation of an Open Banking enables secure data sharing between FIs and third-party providers via standardized Application Programming Interface (APIs). This initiative is expected to accelerate fintech innovation, improve customer experience, and increase competition in the payments space.

The Bank has two documents; the Regulatory Framework on Open Banking in Nigeria and the Operational Guidelines for Opening Banking in Nigeria.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives
Open (API) Banking (cont.)

The policies were in response to the growing integration of banks and other financial institutions with innovators in the financial services space and the increasing adoption of Application Programming Interface (API) based integrations in the industry, and developed in collaboration with a wide section of stakeholders.

Open Banking is an arrangement that fosters the sharing and leveraging of customer-permissioned data by banks with third-party firms to build solutions and services that provide efficiency, greater financial transparency, and options for account holders and to enhance access to financial services in Nigeria.

The main objective of open banking is to provide an enabling regulatory environment for provision of innovative and customer-centric financial services through the safe utilization and exchange of data and services; and promote healthy competition in banking and other financial services.`,

    `Payments System Initiatives
Open (API) Banking (cont.)

Regulatory requirements define a risk based approach to who (licensed and non licensed) can have access to what type of customer information and requires the consent of the customer before any information can be passed on to the third party.

Services that can be developed are limitless. However, some notable ones include: payment initiation services, account aggregation, automated budgeting, instant loans and credit scoring, automated invoice reconciliation, multibanking platforms, personalized marketing, real-time fraud detection, Opening new accounts, etc.

Ongoing activities towards the implementation of Open banking include:
1. Inauguration of the Open Banking Steering Committee and work streams
2. The work stream are working towards deliverables, which include, API Standard, Automated consent management, registration process, risk management, dispute resolution, security, etc.
3. Third quarter, 2025 has tentatively been agreed as go-live`,
    
    `Nigerian CBDC - eNaira`,
    
    `- A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by its central bank. Unlike physical money such as coins and banknotes, CBDCs exist purely in electronic form and are backed by the government, ensuring their value remains stable. They are distinct from cryptocurrencies, which are privately issued and often volatile in value.

- Nigeria's CBDC, eNaira, represents a significant step in Nigeria's financial evolution as Africa's first Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Since its launch in October 2021, the eNaira has positioned Nigeria at the forefront of digital currency innovation among developed and developing economies.`,

    `Challenges in the Payments System

The financial landscape has transformed significantly over the past decade, with financial technology/innovative digital financial services emerging as a disruptive force that has revolutionized traditional financial services. These technologies have brought about significant efficiencies, cost savings, and expanded access to financial services, making them increasingly popular among consumers and businesses. Notwithstanding this, the following are some of the challenges that still exist:
1. Infrastructure Gaps
   a. Limited access points in rural and remote areas due to poor road, telecom, and power infrastructure
   b. Low Inadequate agent networks and low ATM/POS penetration in northern and riverine communities
   c. Intermittent internet and unreliable mobile connectivity for digital financial services.
2. Low Financial Literacy, customer education and Mistrust in formal financial institutions`,

4. OVERVIEW OF THE HRPPM
2025 EXAM PREPARATION`,

    `MENTORING IN THE WORKPLACE
Why is mentorship important?
Mentoring programs in the workplace leverage existing resources and key personnel to help employees grow and thrive. Mentorship programs are key for employee retention and satisfaction.
In a survey of millennials by Deloitte, employees who said they plan to stay with their employer for more than five years were twice as likely to have a mentor (68% with, compared to 32% without).`,

    `Mentorship programs benefit employers and employees in multiple measurable and visible ways:
- 01 Improved Personal and Career Development
- 02 Improved Onboarding and Productivity
- 03 Leadership Development
- 04 Builds Diversity
- 05 Allows for Reverse Mentoring
- 06 Supports a Learning Culture
- 07 Reduces Costs`,

    `Steps in Mentorship programs:
- 01 Define the program's goal
- 02 Outline the mentoring process in the workplace
- 03 Select program participants
- 04 Match mentors and mentees
- 05 Provide mentorship training`,

    `Types of Mentoring
There are various ways to establish a mentorship program, based on preferences. Here's a look at the different kinds of mentoring:
- Supervisory: The classic set-up: an older employee serves as a mentor to a younger mentee.
- Group: One mentor with multiple mentees.
- Reverse: A younger employee serves as the mentor and an older employee is the mentee.
- Peer: A mentor paired with a mentee that are on the same level within the organization.
- Team: One mentee has multiple mentors.`,

    `Pitfalls to Avoid
- 01 Poor selection of mentors
- 02 Poor matching of mentors and mentees
- 03 Lacking a practical approach
- 04 Lacking a referee or someone to measure the process
- 05 Making it look like a quick fix rather than well-thought-out plan
- 06 Using it to replace performance management
- 07 No participant direction when choosing mentor
- 08 Low mentoring participation
- 09 Limited training for mentors
- 10 Lack of structure for mentoring conversations`,

    `What is Performance?
PERFORMANCE
the action or process of carrying out or accomplishing an action, task, or function; an action, task, or operation, seen in terms of how successfully it was performed (New American Oxford Dictionary).
It is about turning input to output.
INPUT -> OUTPUT
Performance is about doing work and achieving results.`,

    `Performance Management Cycle
1. Performance Planning
2. Coaching (Observation & Feedback)
3. Performance Appraisal/Review
4. Performance Development Plan
(Ongoing feedback/performance dialogues connect all stages)`,

    `Difference between Performance Management and Performance Appraisal
- Basis For Comparison | Performance Appraisal | Performance Management
- What is it? | It is a system | It is a process
- Nature/Type of Tool | Operational Tool | Strategic Tool
- Frequency | Quarterly / Annually | Dynamic, Continuously
- Approach | Individualistic | Holistic
- Focused on | Quantitative / Qualitative Aspects | Qualitative Aspects
- Corrections | Retrospective | Prospective
- Owned by | Human Resources | Line Manager
- Relationship | Subset of Performance Management | End-to-End`,

    `PMS in the CBN
- Two types of Appraisal:
  - Yearly Appraisal – confirmed staff
  - Quarterly Appraisal – staff on probation
- The appraisal system in the Bank is electronically driven via Oracle ERP.`,

    `What IS measured?
- Skills: These are the 5 objectives for Executives and Senior staff and 4 objectives for Junior.
- Behavioral: Competencies 12 for Executives/Senior and 8 for Junior.`,

    `CBN Appraisal Rating Scale
- E=Exceptional = Performance consistently far exceeds all expectations; conspicuously meritorious performance.
- D=Distinguished = Performance generally exceeds expectations or job requirements.
- C=Competent = Performance meets expectations or set goals.
- M=Marginal = Performance is below acceptable standards/set goals.
- U=Unacceptable = Performance is well below minimum standards; requires immediate remedial action.`,

    `Snapshot on Challenges with PMS in CBN
- Little or no performance planning - performance objectives, measures and targets are not set at the beginning of the performance cycle
- Lack of clarity and inadequate performance management skills constrained performance culture
- Absence of human resource measures (individual score card) for determining effectiveness
- Performance appraisals are overtly subjective and unreliable, and perceived to be so
- Weak monitoring of the process by the lines and HR
- Insufficient education and communication on the PMS
- Weak linkage of performance management to learning and development and career development
- Poor execution of consequence management system
- Difficulty in using the performance management module on Oracle ERP`,

    `Why subjective ratings by Managers in CBN
- Belief that providing low or average ratings will reflect poorly on them as leaders.
- Concern of angering or demotivating employees by providing low or average ratings.
- Organizational norms for providing higher ratings.
- Desire to be liked by direct reports and therefore seeking to provide higher ratings to make them happy.
- Desire to obtain the highest possible rewards for direct reports.
- Avoid confrontation from subordinates due to lack of proper record keeping.`,

    `Recommendations for Improvement
1. Improve reliability/objectivity of Appraisals
- Ensure effective performance planning, including performance cascade and objective setting, at the beginning of the year before mid February.
- Train line managers in effective supervision, including planning, providing performance feedback, documenting performance issues, and coaching.
- Reflect SBU performance in the distributions of individual performance ratings such that percentage of exceptional or poor performers are not the same in all SBUs.
- Introduce sanctions for clear cases of bias in appraisals.`,

    `Recommendations for Improvement
2. Manage the process more effectively
- Timelines: Monitor completion of appraisals from Mid-November to End of January; complete performance planning (from January to Mid-February).
- Communication and Education: Arrange for automatic prompts and countdown; Educate staff on the objectives of the PMS; Communicate sanctions for non compliance clearly.
- Ensure quarterly performance reviews by requesting that staff send confirmation of performance review discussions to their SBU PMS support unit.
- The process for managing grievances or disagreements arising from appraisals should be documented and clearly communicated.`,

    `Recommendations for Improvement
3. Ensure better linkage of PMS to staff development and career progression / promotion
- Completing the Questionnaire (on appraisee SWOT) is now a compulsory field on the ERP, monitor the quality of input.
- HR should generate the report of the questionnaire and send to CDD/SBU Learning Committees for appraisee's development needs.
- Create and formalise more development activities, such as job rotation and succession planning linked to performance.`,

    `Recommendations for Improvement
4. Provide more support and simplicity to the process:
- Develop user guides, not only for the technology, but for the entire process.
- Make the technology easier and more intuitive.
- Create local PMS support units in SBUs teams to ensure effective performance dialogues throughout the year and provide local support for the process.
- Train key HR staff and local PMS support units in SBUs to train and provide support to staff on the PMS.`,

    `Role of the HRD in the Implementation of the Strategy
- Identification of desired organizational core competencies and available competencies.
- Identify initiatives to bridge required competencies to deliver on various themes.
- Connect People to Strategy– ensuring alignment of individuals to the strategy with a clear line of sight.
- Alignment of talent management process, incentives and recognition.
- Alignment of PMS to the strategy to ensure clear performance expectation and measurement.
- Facilitate the attainment of a befitting corporate culture that drives productivity and supports the strategy.
- Leadership Development – availability of qualified leaders at critical levels to mobilise and lead the execution of the strategy.
- Ensure right people are in the right jobs at the right times, with the right competencies to be able to 'make the strategy happen'.`,

    `PENSIONS & GRATUITY
- Final entitlement connotes last payment to be made to an employee at the end of an employment period.
- Before the Pension Act of 2004, we had Pension and Gratuity.
- Pension: A monthly stipend paid to a retiree after service.
- Gratuity: This is a one-off payment made to a retiree after a service period of 35 years or 60 years of age, whichever comes first.`,

    `Pension Fund Management
- Pension Fund Administrators – take investment decisions.
- In some jurisdictions, pension fund management can be by asset management and insurance companies.
- Some management decisions may be the responsibility of Boards of Trustees in some corporate organisations.
- Pension Fund Custodians – keep custody of pension funds.
- Custodial services may be provided by Central Banks in some jurisdictions.
- In the UK, Pension Protection Fund provides compensation to contributors where employers become insolvent.`,

    `PENSIONS Administration in CBN

- The trait of being well behaved
- The act of punishing offenders
- Complying with the predefined rules and regulations of the organisation`,

    `DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM

- A good disciplinary system consists of the following:
  - The Organization
  - Established Rules and Standards
  - Communicated rules and Standards
  - Assessment of Behaviour and Performance
  - Process of changing inappropriate behaviour
- The goal of a good disciplinary system is behaviour modification, i.e. modifying unacceptable behaviour and conduct`,

    `DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM
- Conduct problems occur when employees fail to comply with rules and regulations that guide the work environment.
- Employees that consistently break the rules are usually referred to as “problem employees".`,

    `DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM FLOWCHART
The Organisation -> Establish rules & standards -> Communicate rules & standards -> Assess behavior & performance -> Attempt to change inappropriate behaviour`,

    `DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE
- Disciplinary procedure in CBN
- Stages in the disciplinary procedure`,

    `DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE
- Handling employee misconduct is a very critical task normally performed by the top management of organizations.
- To manage discipline among employees, every organization opts for a disciplinary policy which describes the approach it will apply in dealing with misconduct by employees.
- The Central Bank of Nigeria encourages fair, efficient and equitable solutions to problems arising out of the employment relationships and to meet the requirements of the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
- The Bank thus encourages fair adjudication/resolution of issues arising from reported cases of unsatisfactory performance/conduct and grievances respectively. Pursuant to this a disciplinary procedure has been established in the Bank.`,

    `DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE IN CBN
Purpose:
- To make employees aware of behaviour and/or performance which the Bank considers to be unacceptable and to indicate corrective action which must be taken if the employee is to remain in the Bank's employment.
- To remove from the Bank's employment any employee whose behaviour sets bad example to others and/or is likely to bring the name of the Bank to disrepute, cause a breach of peace or disharmony in the Bank.
- To Discourage other employees from behaviours that are contrary to Bank's rules and regulations`,

    `DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE IN CBN
- The scope of the disciplinary procedure in CBN covers all activities/tasks involved in handling cases of misconduct and fraud against staff in the Bank from the period it is discovered/reported till the application of sanction (if any).
- Chapter 6.4 of the Human Resources Policies and Procedure Manual (HRPPM) provides the policy framework for the disciplinary procedure in the Bank.
- The chapter lists acts that constitute “MISCONDUCT AND GROSS MISCONDUCT" and provides sanctions and disciplinary procedures for such acts. All employees are therefore expected to acquaint themselves with the rules, regulations, procedures and standard of conduct established by the Bank.`,

    `DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE IN CBN
The following are behaviours constituting gross misconduct for which summary dismissal is normally appropriate:
- Conviction for a criminal offence, except conviction for traffic offences.

- Grievance procedure is a formal communication between an employee and the Management designed for the settlement of grievances.`,

    `GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
The Grievance procedure in CBN typically has 5 stages:
- Stage 1: Discuss grievance with immediate supervisor/superior who should attempt to resolve it.
- Stage 2: If unresolved after 2 working days, the aggrieved employee can escalate to the next level Line Manager.
- Stage 3: If still unresolved, the matter is referred to the elected representative of the JCC who might raise it with the Head of SBU.
- Stage 4: After 4 working days, the matter could be referred to the Council members, then to Director of Human Resources (DHR), through Head, ER&WD and should be resolved within 4 working days.
- Stage 5: Thereafter, if it is not resolved, it is raised with the JCC with Management representatives in attendance.`,
